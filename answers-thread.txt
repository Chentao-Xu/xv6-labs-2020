Thread 1: Calls put(42, 100).
Calculates i = 42 % NBUCKET.
Searches table[i] and finds that key 42 is not present (e == 0).
Prepares to call insert() to add key 42.

Context Switch to Thread 2:
Thread 2 calls put(42, 200).
Calculates i = 42 % NBUCKET (same bucket as Thread 1).
Searches table[i] and also finds that key 42 is not present (e == 0).
Calls insert() and successfully adds key 42 with value 200.

Context Switch Back to Thread 1:
Thread 1 resumes and calls insert() with key 42 and value 100.
Overwrites table[i]'s head pointer with its new entry, effectively discarding Thread 2's changes.

Result:
Key 42 is present in the hash table, but earlier insertions or subsequent keys in the linked list (if any) may be lost.
This corruption could lead to missing keys from the hash table.
